# IRPML 
This repository contains Matlab Implementation of Learning algorithms with objective to encode a given task into
a parameterized Normal Distribution based on multiple demonstrations; in this case the algorithms are used to learn 
joint angle trajectories of a manipulator robot/ biped robot:
* A Cross Entropy based algorithm implemented under "CEM.m".
* A Path IntegralsÂ² algorithm implemented under "PI_2_std.m".
# Teaching Box
The code under "CoBrasTeachingBox.m" implement a GUI interface permitting the connection to an Arduino driven Robot Arm 
and the data gathering of the demonstrated tasks.
# Licensing 
No sort of licensing is currently available for the current repository.
